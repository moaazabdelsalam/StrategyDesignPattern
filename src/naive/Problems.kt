/**
 * Violates Single Responsibility Principle.
 * Violates Open/Closed Principle: Adding a new payment method requires modifying.
 * payment logic is not reusable elsewhere.
 * Tight Coupling/Difficult to Test: You canâ€™t test individual payment logic in isolation.
 * Scaling Becomes a Nightmare: The more payment types you add, the more unreadable the checkout() method becomes.
